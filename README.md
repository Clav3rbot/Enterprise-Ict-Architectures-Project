# Enterprise ICT Architectures Project

University project for the Enterprise ICT Architectures course at Bocconi University.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains three project deliveries, each focusing on different database technologies and enterprise information system architectures. The project demonstrates practical implementation of various data management approaches, from traditional relational databases to modern NoSQL solutions and web applications.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

### Delivery 1 - Relational Database Design
Design and implementation of a relational database system.

- **ER Diagram**: Conceptual database modeling
- **Relational Schema**: Translation from ER model to relational schema
- **SQL Implementation**: Database creation, data population, and queries
- **Tools**: MySQL, SQLite, Mockaroo (synthetic data generation)

### Delivery 2 - BPMN & Graph Database
Business process modeling and graph-based data structures.

- **BPMN Diagrams**: Business Process Model and Notation
  - Exercise 2.1 and 2.2: Process flow diagrams
- **Neo4j Implementation**: Graph database system
  - Complex relationship queries and pattern analysis
  - Database dump for backup/restore operations

### Delivery 3 - NoSQL & Web Development
Modern web application with NoSQL database backend.

- **MongoDB**: Document-oriented NoSQL database
  - Data schema for music festival management (festivals, persons, stages, stands, tickets, relationships)
  - CRUD operations and advanced queries
- **Web Application**: Full-stack web development
  - **Task 1**: Interactive festival webpage
  - **Task 2**: User authentication system
    - Node.js backend
    - Relational database for user management
    - Frontend with login/registration functionality

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Relational Databases**: MySQL, SQLite
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB
- **Process Modeling**: BPMN
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js
- **Tools**: Mockaroo, Diagrams.net

## 📁 Repository Organization

Each delivery is organized in its own folder containing all necessary files including:
- Database schemas
- SQL/Cypher queries
- Source code
- Database dumps
- Screenshots and documentation
